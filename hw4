The piece of work I am taking a look at is the BBC's article following Brunei's decision to punish same sex relationships with stoning - https://www.bbc.com/news/world-45434583

This piece of work visualised the data for countries which punished same sex relations.

![bbc chart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47171384/55488608-f218b500-5662-11e9-9825-10eb18455454.png)

However, the issue with this data visualisation is that it is too oversimplified. It just notes which countries have crimilised homosexulaity, without mentioning to what extent.

The text underneath the map chart notes which countries have death as punishment, but you would not get the information from looking at the chart alone. Thus I have created me own chart. The countries in green have laws against homosexuality but not punishable by death, but those in red do carry death as a punishment.
